vs-default-build-package
------------------------

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above now support
  adding the PACKAGE target to the targets which are built by default.
  The behavior is similar to :variable:`CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_INSTALL_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD`
  and can be toggled using :variable:`CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_PACKAGE_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD`.
