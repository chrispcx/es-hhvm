/**
 * @class SerialExecutor
 *
 * @brief Executor that guarantees serial non-concurrent execution of added
 *     tasks
 *
 * SerialExecutor is similar to boost asio's strand concept. A SerialExecutor
 * has a parent executor which is given at construction time (defaults to
 * wangle's global CPUExecutor). Tasks added to SerialExecutor are executed
 * in the parent executor, however strictly non-concurrently and in the order
 * they were added.
 *
 * SerialExecutor tries to schedule its tasks fairly. Every task submitted to
 * it results in one task submitted to the parent executor. Whenever the parent
 * executor executes one of those, one of the tasks submitted to SerialExecutor
 * is marked for execution, which means it will either be executed at once,
 * or if a task is currently being executed already, after that.
 *
 * The SerialExecutor may be deleted at any time. All tasks that have been
 * submitted will still be executed with the same guarantees, as long as the
 * parent executor is executing tasks.
