/**
 * Cycles is a lightweight API for measuring CPU cycles of systems that
 * do asynchronous request processing.
 * It works by aggregating together parts of the request processing (e.g.
 * different EventBase loops related to the same request) to compute the
 * total number of CPU cycles used by each request.
 * The API was designed with effiency in mind, so it safe to leave it operating
 * in an "always-on" mode with minimal performance impact.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 *  1) Start the API on application startup.
 *    // Attach all EventBases that are used to process requests.
 *    cycles::attachEventBase();
 *
 *    // Start the thread that reports the aggregated results.
 *    cycles::startExtracting();
 *
 *  2) Use the API
 *    // Delimit an interval and label it:
 *    cycles::start();
 *    ...
 *    cycles::label();
 *    ...
 *    cycles::finish();
 *
 *    // Notes:
 *    //  - Each request can be composed of one or more labeled intervals.
 *    //    The cycles API will take care of aggregating together intervals
 *    //    processed in the same thread that have the same label.
 *    //  - Consider using cycles::IntervalGuard class instead of explicitly
 *    //    calling cycles::start() and cycles::finish().
 *
 *  3) Stop extracting on application shutdown.
 *    // Stop the extractor thread.
 *    cycles::stopExtracting();
