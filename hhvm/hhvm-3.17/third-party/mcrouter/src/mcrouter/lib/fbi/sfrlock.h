/**
 * This file and its matching .c file contain the implementation of a small
 * (8 bytes) non-recursive unfair read/write lock that is optimized for uses
 * when reads are common and writes less so.
 *
 * The state of the lock itself is fully described by sfrlock::value, which is
 * composed of two fields: a 1-bit "write locked" (W), and a 31-bit "reader
 * count" (R). In the description that follows, states are described as ordered
 * sets containing the values of W and R. The following are the valid states:
 *
 * 1. { 0, 0 } -- No one owns the lock.
 * 2. { 1, 0 } -- Writer owns the lock exclusively.
 * 3. { 0, N } -- N readers share ownership of the lock.
 * 4. { 1, N } -- N readers share ownership of the lock, but there's a writer
 *                waiting to take ownership.
 *
 * In addition to the state described above, the lock also contains a "waiter
 * count", which indicates to writers if they should make the futex wake system
 * call when the following transition just happened:
 *
 * { 1, 0 } -> { 0, 0 } -- that is, when the writer releases the lock.
 *
 * When readers release the lock, three different types of transitions can
 * happen:
 *
 * { X, N + 1 } -> { X, N } -- this is when a reader which isn't the last one
 * releases the lock. In this case the system call is never made because no
 * waiter would be able to make progress, in fact, only writers can be waiting.
 *
 * { 0, 1 } -> { 0, 0 } -- this is when the last reader releases the lock, but
 * there are no writers attempting to own the lock (and readers wouldn't wait,
 * they'd just acquire it), so the system call isn't made either.
 *
 * { 1, 1 } -> { 1, 0 } -- this is when the last reader releases the lock, and
 * there is a writer waiting. In this case the wake system call is made.
 *
 * N.B. The cost to perform a system call in the uncontended path is
 *      prohibitively high, that's why we only do it when there are waiters.
 *
 * Write lock uncontended acquisition:
 * { 0, 0 } -> { 1, 0 } -- Just flip the W bit to 1.
 *
 * Write lock contended acquistion:
 * { 0, N } -> { 1, N } -> { 1, N - 1 } -> ... -> { 1, 0 } -- in the presence
 * of N readers, the writer first sets the W bit (which prevents new readers
 * from acquiring the lock, and also keeps contending writers at bay), then
 * waits for all the readers to release the lock (i.e., wait for R to drop from
 * N to 0).
 *
 * { 1, N } -> ... -> { 0, 0 } -> { 1, 0 } -- in the presence of another writer
 * and potentially other readers, it first waits for everyone to release the
 * lock, then acquires it. It must be noted, however, that there is no
 * indication to potentially contending readers that there's a writer waiting,
 * so it is possible that a reader (or another writer for that matter) swoops
 * in and takes the lock before the current thread, in which case it will have
 * to retry one of the contended acquisition paths. The lock is unfair when
 * multiple writers are attempting to acquire it.
 *
 * Read lock uncontended acquisitions:
 * { 0, 0 } -> { 0, 1 } -- First reader.
 * { 0, N - 1 } -> { 0, N } -- N-th reader.
 *
 * Read lock contended acquisition:
 * { 1, 0 } -> { 0, 0 } -> { 0, 1 } -- waits for writer to release lock.
 * { 1, N } -> { 1, N - 1 } -> ... -> { 1, 0 } -> { 0, 0 } -> { 0, 1 } -- in
 * this case, a write is in the process of acquiring the lock, so we must
 * first wait for everyone to release it.
