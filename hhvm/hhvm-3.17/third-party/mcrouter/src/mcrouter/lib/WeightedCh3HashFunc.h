/**
 * A weighted CH3 hash function.
 *
 * Each server is assigned a weight between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.
 * The algorithm:
 *
 *   Try 32 times:
 *     index = CH3(key + next_salt(), n)
 *     probability = SpookyHashV2_uint32(key)
 *     if (probability < server_weight[index] * uint32_max):
 *       return index
 *   return index
 *
 * Where next_salt() initially returns an empty string, and subsequently
 * distinct salt strings.
 * (the actual salts used are strings "0", "1", ..., "9", "01", "11", "21",
 *  i.e. reversed decimal representations of an increasing counter).
 *
 * Note that if all weights are 1.0, the algorithm returns the same indices
 * as simply CH3(key, n).
 *
 * The algorithm is consistent both with respect to individual weights and
 * mostly consistent wrt n. i.e. reducing any single weight slightly will
 * only spread out a small fraction of the load from that server to all other
 * servers, but changing the number of servers may involve some spillover.
 * Consistency is a function of how far the weights are from 1, with all weights
 * at 1 being perfectly consistent
