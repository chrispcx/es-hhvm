Using Thrift with PHP
=====================

The Thrift library for PHP requires PHP 5, with PHP 5.6+ recommended. It is a
transpiled version of the Thrift library for Hack, and thus also requires the
hacklib library distributed with HHVM.

To use Thrift in your PHP codebase, take the following steps:

#1) Copy all of thrift/lib/php/src into your PHP codebase
#2) Copy the Hacklib library into your PHP codebase (see below)
#3) Set $GLOBALS['THRIFT_ROOT'] to the path you installed Thrift
#4) Set $GLOBALS['HACKLIB_ROOT'] to the path of hacklib.php

If you do not do #3, Thrift.php will set this global for you, but it will be
done using dirname(__FILE__), which is less efficient than providing the static
string yourself.

This library is transpiled from Hack, and requires the hacklib library
distributed with HHVM, found at

https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/tree/master/hphp/hack/src/h2tp/resources

When you generate a Thrift package using the compiler, by default it makes an
assumption about where your generated code will live (autoloading is also
supported via the "norequires" option). If your file is "MyPackage.thrift",
the generated files must be installed into:

$GLOBALS['THRIFT_ROOT'].'/packages/MyPackage/';

This allows the code generator to compile your code without any extra flags
for the target directory names while still allowing your include paths to
be absolute (if you have an absolute THRIFT_ROOT).

Dependencies
============

PHP_INT_SIZE

  This built-in signals whether your architecture is 32 or 64 bit and is
  used by the TBinaryProtocol to properly use pack() and unpack() to
  serialize data.

apc_fetch(), apc_store()

  APC cache is used by the TSocketPool class. If you do not have APC installed,
  Thrift will fill in null stub function definitions.
