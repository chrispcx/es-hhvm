Included in structs to specify a Python type. Typically this is used in
a method declaration to indicate what kind of object Cython can accept.
It is also used in certain cast situations where we have received a PyObject
and need to refer to a C member on that object. We have to cast the object in
order to be aware that it even has that member.
