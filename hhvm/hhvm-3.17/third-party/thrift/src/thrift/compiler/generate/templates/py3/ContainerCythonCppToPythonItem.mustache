Usually included in places where a container item is being processed. You have
access to a C object and need to return or convert it to a Python object. The
type in this case is probably a type:listElemType, type:setElemType,
type:keyType, or type:valueType.

By convention, it assumes the c++ structure that is being manipulated is named
citem.
